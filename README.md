# Live-Portfolio
Portfolio to display samples of work

Navigation bar at top of page allows user to navigate directly to desired section.

About me section shows basic background information.

My work is showcased with one focused project and three smaller projects. These tiles are links to deployed webpages so a user can see my actual work.

The contact section allows a user to contact me directly via email/phone or view my linkedIn or GitHub profiles.

Webpage will adapt to mobile viewports and remain usable.
